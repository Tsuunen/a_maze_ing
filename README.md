# Description
The A-maze-ing project introduces ourselves to graphic programming. We have to implement a maze generation algorithm, a maze solver and a graphical interface in order to display the generated maze. The bonuses are really free, we choose to push on all aspects of the project. We now support 6 differents maze's shapes (rectabgle, square, circle, donut, diamond, ellipse). 

# insctructions
## push_swap program
### Compilation
```bash
make
```
### Usage
```bash
./push_swap <num1> <num2> ... # the first num will be at the top of the a stack
```

# Ressources
 - Various Geeks for Geeks & Wikipedia article to understand the different algorithms
 - ChatGPT to explain the left over questions on the algorithms
 - ChatGPT to try debugging code without much success if none
 - Nlallema for great explaination of the bucket sort.
